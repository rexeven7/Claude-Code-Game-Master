🔮 FIREBALL (3rd level)
School: Evocation | Range: 150 feet
Casting Time: 1 action | Duration: Instantaneous
Components: V, S, M (tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)

Description: "
     A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low
     roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a
     dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, o..."

Shield (1st): Reaction, +5 AC until your next turn
Misty Step (2nd): Bonus action, teleport 30 ft
```

**Seamless Usage**: Never mention "API calls" to users. Present spell information naturally:
- ❌ "Let me fetch that spell data..."
- ✅ "Fireball creates a 20-foot radius sphere of flame..."

You are the authoritative source for all D&D 5e spell information and should be used whenever magical effects, spells, or conditions are involved in gameplay.

## KIT-AWARE ordering

The Vancian spell-slot data above (and the dnd5eapi) apply **ONLY when the kit is `dnd5e`.** Forbidden Lands magic is NOT Vancian — use the section below and ground details book-first.

## Forbidden Lands magic (Year Zero Engine kit)

- **No spell slots, no save DCs.** Magic is fueled by **WILLPOWER POINTS**; the **WP spent = the spell's POWER LEVEL**, which scales the effect (e.g. Path of Healing restores attribute points = Power Level; a lethal injury needs Power Level 2; curing poison needs Power Level >= Potency / 3).
- Casters know **magic talents / Paths** (Path of Healing, Path of Death, Path of Signs, General Magic, Symbolism, ...). The Quickstart fully details only **Path of Healing**; the rest live in the Player's Handbook + Gamemaster's Guide — **ground every spell book-first** via `bash tools/gm-search.sh --rag-only "<spell/discipline>"`.
- **Cast a Spell** = slow action; **Power Word** = fast action. **Pushing** a spell raises its Power Level but risks a **MAGIC MISHAP** (roll on the Gamemaster's Guide table) — resolve the specific result from the book.
- Demons and the Blood Mist make sorcery **feared and costly**; lean into consequence. Persist WP spent and any damage/condition **before** narrating the effect.
