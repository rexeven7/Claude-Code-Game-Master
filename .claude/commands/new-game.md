# /new-game - Create Your World

Author an original world that plays as *its own game* — grounded by the same
spine an imported book gets: a `world-bible.json`, a `ruleset.json` World Kit, and
an embedded source corpus. The pipeline is **seed → skeleton → fan-out →
reconcile → ground**, so the world does not drift to generic D&D.

> Architecture: original creation *authors* a book's worth of canon, then runs it
> through the SAME grounding machinery import uses. Specialist authors run in
> parallel; each writes ONLY its own files; a serial consolidate folds them in.

## PHASE A — SEED (genre-aware questionnaire)

Create + switch the campaign first:

```bash
bash tools/gm-campaign.sh create "<CAMPAIGN_NAME>"
bash tools/gm-campaign.sh switch "<CAMPAIGN_NAME>"
CAMPAIGN_DIR=$(bash tools/gm-campaign.sh path)
```
(If the name exists: offer switch / rename / recreate.)

Run the questionnaire with **AskUserQuestion**. Ask for: a one-line **premise**
(free text — "Conan but on a drowned coast"), **tone**, **magic level**, and
**setting type** (reuse the classic options). Then ALWAYS ask the **genre bend** —
the single most important anti-generic lever:

Also ask the **voice** question — *"Whose voice should this world be narrated in?"*
— with genre-adaptive suggestions + free text (e.g. sword-and-sorcery → Robert E.
Howard; high fantasy → Tolkien / Le Guin; sci-fantasy → Gibson; whimsical →
Pratchett). Store as `voice_exemplar`. This is what makes narration read like a
real author instead of a generic narrator.

Genre bend options:

- *Sword-and-sorcery (Conan):* magic = blood/curse-priced and villainous; bronze-age
  tech; decadent kingdoms vs. barbarian frontier.
- *High fantasy (Tolkien):* deep lineage/ancestry; a pantheon + old songs; pastoral
  vs. rising dark.
- *Tech / sci-fantasy:* nanomagic or charged tech; infrastructure + corporate/clan
  politics.
- *Folk / cosmic horror:* fragile sanity; small community; a wrongness beneath.

From the answers, **derive an ADAPTIVE axis list** — do NOT use a fixed set. Pick
the axes that are load-bearing for THIS genre and mark each `deep` or `stub`:
- always: `geography`, `factions`, `history`.
- sword-and-sorcery → `magic-lore` (deep, blood/curse), `culture` (oaths/idiom); skip heavy tech.
- tech → `technology` (deep, infrastructure), `factions` (deep, corporate/clan).
- high fantasy → `culture`/`language` (deep, lineage + pantheon), `bestiary`.
- horror → `culture` (the community), `bestiary`/`magic-lore` (the wrongness).

Write `world-seed.json` to the campaign dir:

```json
{
  "premise": "...", "tone": "...", "magic": "...", "setting": "...",
  "genre_bend": "<the distinct commitments, in a sentence or two>",
  "voice_exemplar": "<author/work to channel, e.g. 'Robert E. Howard'>",
  "axes": [ { "axis": "geography", "depth": "deep", "bend": "..." },
            { "axis": "magic-lore", "depth": "deep", "bend": "blood-priced curses" },
            { "axis": "bestiary", "depth": "stub", "bend": "..." } ]
}
```

---

## PHASE B — SKELETON (one pass, while the seed is fresh)

YOU (the main GM agent) author the full creative skeleton NOW, in one pass, while
all the seed context is fresh in mind. This is the coherence anchor every parallel
author will carry — get the world's identity right here.

Write `world-bible.json` to the campaign dir with `confirmed: false` and ALL
required keys (validated by `lib/world_bible.py`): `name`, `voice`
(`style`/`vocab`/`sample_passages`), `tone`, `themes`, `factions`

**Author the `voice` block from `voice_exemplar`** — this is how the GM narrates
in the author's voice at play (surfaced every beat by `get_full_context`):
- `style`: a concrete prose fingerprint imitating the exemplar (sentence rhythm,
  diction, imagery) — not "epic fantasy" but e.g. "Howard's terse, muscular cadence;
  sensory violence; archaic but plain diction."
- `sample_passages`: 2-3 SHORT passages YOU write *in that author's voice* (original
  imitation, NOT copied from the real author's text) so the GM has a concrete target.
- `vocab`: a few signature in-world terms.
The `culture` axis (Phase C) may deepen `vocab` + add passages.

Other required keys: `factions`
(`{nodes:[],edges:[]}` — seed the major ones), `geography` (`{nodes,edges}` — the
starting region + a few named places beyond the village), `signature_systems` (the
distinctive magic/tech, named), and a short `timeline`. Make it specific and
distinct — this is the spine, not a stub.

Validate, then present for approval:
```bash
uv run python lib/world_bible.py validate
uv run python lib/world_bible.py show
```

Show the user the `name`, voice style, themes, factions, and signature systems.
**Gate the fan-out on their approval** — let them edit or accept. Do not proceed
until they accept. (The bible stays `confirmed: false` until Phase E.)

---

## PHASE C — FAN-OUT (parallel authors + the kit owner)

Launch ALL of these **simultaneously** as parallel Task calls (like /import's
extractors). One `world-author` per axis in `world-seed.json`, plus one
`world-kit-author`:

```
Task: subagent_type=world-author
prompt: "Author the '<AXIS>' axis (DEPTH=<deep|stub>) for the active campaign.
         Read world-seed.json + world-bible.json (canon). Write ONLY
         canon/<AXIS>.md and authored/<AXIS>.json per your contract. bend: <bend>."
   ... (repeat for every axis) ...

Task: subagent_type=world-kit-author
prompt: "Author ruleset.json for the active campaign from world-seed.json +
         world-bible.json. Derive mechanics from the world; do not default to 5e."
```

Wait for ALL to complete. Each writes its own files only → no collisions.

---

## PHASE D — RECONCILE (anti-drift)

```
Task: subagent_type=world-reconciler
prompt: "Reconcile the active campaign: read world-seed.json, world-bible.json,
         all authored/*.json, canon/*.md, ruleset.json. Run the genericness
         critic, kit↔flavor agreement, and graph cross-link. Write
         reconcile-report.json and apply low-risk cross-link edits."
```

Read `reconcile-report.json`. If `verdict: needs-changes`, apply the rewrites /
kit patches (re-run the relevant `world-author` / `world-kit-author`, or edit the
authored files), then re-reconcile. Surface generic flags + kit disagreements to
the user if judgment is needed.

---

## PHASE E — GROUND (consolidate → embed → confirm → validate)

```bash
# 1. Fold authored contributions into runtime state + the bible (serial, race-free)
bash tools/gm-worldgen.sh consolidate

# 2. Compile authored canon into one document
CANON=$(bash tools/gm-worldgen.sh compile-canon --json | uv run python -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['path'])")

# 3. Embed it for RAG — same path imports use (writes current-document.txt + chunks + vectors)
bash tools/gm-extract.sh prepare "$CANON" "<CAMPAIGN_NAME>"

# 4. Confirm the bible (the human approved it in Phase B; world is now grounded)
uv run python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'lib'); from world_bible import WorldBible; WorldBible().confirm()"
```

Then run **`/world-check`** (or `uv run python lib/schemas.py`) to validate the
generated world. Fix anything it flags before play.

---

## PHASE F — OVERVIEW, SESSION LOG, HANDOFF

Update `campaign-overview.json` (starting location from the bible's geography,
date/time, `session_count: 0`) and initialize `session-log.md` with the world
summary (starting location, key NPCs, the three plot tiers). Then display a
summary box and hand off:

```
Your world awaits its hero! Now let's create your character...
```

Run **`/create-character`**.

---

## COMPLETION CHECKLIST
- [ ] `world-seed.json` with an adaptive axis list
- [ ] `world-bible.json` authored in one pass, approved, `confirmed: true` after grounding
- [ ] `ruleset.json` World Kit (non-5e-default, derived from the world)
- [ ] every axis produced `canon/<axis>.md` + `authored/<axis>.json`
- [ ] `reconcile-report.json` verdict handled
- [ ] consolidated `locations/npcs/facts.json` + merged bible graphs
- [ ] `current-document.txt` embedded (RAG returns hits)
- [ ] `/world-check` passes
- [ ] overview + session log set; handed off to `/create-character`

## ERROR RECOVERY
- Campaign exists → switch / rename / recreate.
- An author returns empty/invalid → re-launch just that axis.
- Bible fails validation → fix the missing required key, re-validate before fan-out.
- `prepare` finds no text → confirm `compile-canon` wrote a non-empty file.
