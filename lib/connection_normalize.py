"""Normalize location connection targets to real keys; relocate rule-phrases.

Connection `to` values are a mix of real locations with drift ("Station 435 (end of
line)" vs the key "...(End of the Line)") and pattern/rule statements that are not
places at all ("Any line", "Transfer stations ending in 1", "Upper level via central
stairs"). This canonicalizes resolvable targets via the alias resolver and moves
rule-phrases into the location's `notes` (so they are not silently dropped by
reconcile). Genuinely-missing place names are left for missing-location-reconcile.

Run after cap, before reconcile.
