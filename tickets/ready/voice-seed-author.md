## What to build

Give original worlds an explicit authorial voice to channel. In `/new-game`
(`.claude/commands/new-game.md`):
- Phase A questionnaire gains a **voice** question — "Whose voice should this world
  channel?" with genre-appropriate suggestions (Howard / Tolkien / Le Guin /
  Gibson / Pratchett / free text). Store as `voice_exemplar` in `world-seed.json`.
- Phase B skeleton authoring is instructed to write the bible `voice` block from
  the exemplar: a `style` fingerprint that imitates that author + 2-3 original
  `sample_passages` written in that voice (NOT copied from the author).
- The `culture` axis (when present) deepens `voice.vocab` / additional passages.

Pairs with `voice-context-surfacing`, which surfaces this block at play.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Phase A asks the voice/author question and records `voice_exemplar` in the `world-seed.json` shape
- [ ] Phase B instructs authoring `voice.style` (imitating the exemplar) + 2-3 original `sample_passages` in that voice
- [ ] Suggested exemplars are genre-adaptive (tied to the chosen bend), free-text allowed
- [ ] `sample_passages` for originals are explicitly original imitation, not the author's real text (avoids copying)
- [ ] The `world-seed.json` example in the command shows `voice_exemplar`

## Verification

Lane: agent

Inspect the rewritten command: assert the voice question + `voice_exemplar` seed
field + Phase-B voice-authoring instructions are present and coherent. (Live feel
is judged in the manual dry-run alongside new-game-orchestration.)

## Blocked by

None.
