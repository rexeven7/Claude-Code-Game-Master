## What to build

Quality gate so auto-derived rules don't silently ship generic/wrong. After
import generates the world-bible + drafted ruleset + campaign_rules, present a
review step: show the human the drafted voice/factions/signature-systems +
proposed rules, allow edits, and require confirmation before the world becomes
playable. Middle path between fully-automatic and hand-authored.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Import pauses at a review step presenting the drafted bible + ruleset + campaign_rules in human-readable form. (WorldBible.review_summary provides the draft; /import presents it — model flow)
- [x] The human can edit/approve/reject sections before play starts. (edit world-bible.json then confirm(); reject = leave unconfirmed / re-draft)
- [x] An unconfirmed world is not marked playable. (is_playable() False when bible.confirmed == False)
- [x] Confirmation persists the approved artifacts; rejection allows re-draft. (confirm() sets + saves confirmed:true)
- [x] Manual walkthrough on a sample import shows the gate working end-to-end. (hitl — awaiting your sign-off in in-review)

## QA Reports

### 2026-06-06T05:23:51Z — in-review [ss-tix001]
hitl — implemented; routed to in-review for human sign-off. `uv run pytest` → 132 passed (5 new in tests/test_bible_confirm_gate.py).
- WorldBible.is_confirmed (legacy/no-flag = confirmed; fresh draft = confirmed:false), is_playable (gates only an unconfirmed bible), confirm() (sets+persists), review_summary() (human-facing draft: name/tone/voice/themes/factions/signature_systems).
- Tests: legacy bible playable; confirmed:false → not playable; confirm() → playable after reload; review_summary presents the draft; no-bible campaign playable.
- [human-judgement] The import pause + interactive edit/approve is the /import command's model-driven step on top of these primitives; needs a live walkthrough to sign off.
